# 100 Days of Projects
This repository documents and details my experience with the [100 Days of Code Python course by Angela Yu](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code). I was motivated to take this course not only to increase my skills with Python, but also because I realized how focused my education and knowledge was on data science. I wanted to broaden my experiences with Python and aim to use the course to strengthen my skills in GUI, OOP, UX and web development among many other areas of CS.

For each day of the course, I will add my final project for the day and a readme explaining what the project does along with any notes or areas of interest I want to point out. I mainly made this repo for my own reflection, but feel free to reach out if you have any questions or comments.

For an easier time navigating the projects, check out the page for it on my website [here](https://ryanlonergan.github.io/portfolio/100_days/).
