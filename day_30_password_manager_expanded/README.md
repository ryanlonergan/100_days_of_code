# Password Manager Expanded

<table border='0'>

  This project was an expansion from the previous day and added greater usability for the user. It changed how it stored security details from a plain text file to a json file for easier readability as everything is stored as name/value pair similar to a dictionary. It also added search functionality to retrieve password information and increased error and exception handling overall.

This day was fairly straightforward. I was already familiar with both error handling and json data, so it was not much of a challenge for me, but these smaller changes definitely helped to improve the UX. While I was familiar with handling errors, I never used the full `try`, `except`, `else` and `finally` order, but absolutely see the value. Also, using multiple `except` statements is something I wish I knew and used earlier as there have been many times I have had to re-run hours of machine learning code because errors occurred.
