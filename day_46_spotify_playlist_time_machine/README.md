If you want to run the project yourself, you will need to make a `config.json` file with the following variables:

    "spotify_client_id"  # Personal ID for Spotify Developer App
    "spotify_client_secret"  # Personal Token for Spotify Developer App

The relevant APIs and their functions in the project are:
