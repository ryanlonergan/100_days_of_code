# CSS Resume

<table border='0'>
<tr>
  <td>
  This project was a continuation of the day 42 project and incorporated CSS elements into its design. It discussed the differences for selectors between tag, class, sudo-class and id.
  The day also covered debugging CSS and how useful Chrome DevTools are in that process.

Again, not an overly interesting day. Pacing is way off still in terms of time and difficulty with a large amount of time needed for very small challenges. Howeever, it is building the foundation of CSS which will be needed later on which is something I keep on telling myself so I have more patience. Still, I am not looking forward to the almost 3 hours of videos to watch tomorrow which is still a huge time sink when I watch in double speed. Only 1 more day of this though...
