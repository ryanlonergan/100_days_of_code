    This project improved the website from the previous day with tables and a simple form. It went into how tables are formed to showcase information, but also talked about the deprecation of HTML elements that should be done in CSS instead. It also covered forms and inputs for HTML.

This was a really odd day for the course. It was very, very simple considering the previous lessons and I imagine it is because it comes from an early day from another course. Its not that the information is not useful, its just very easy and as it comes after the difficult capstone from days 39 and 40, the pacing seems way off. Its also kind of odd how she talks about using forms and how they are not too useful without JS, but the course will never cover that. Hopefully the course picks up again soon, but for the next two days, there are 4.5 hours of CSS videos to watch. Not really looking forward to that.
