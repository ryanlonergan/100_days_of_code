# CSS Site

  This project was a continuation of the previous few days and the final lesson for web foundations with HTML and CSS. It created a modern looking personal website focusing primarily on CSS styling and explained the principles behind how to design a website. It changed the layout of the page by removing the vast majority of the HTML styling and instead moved it to the CSS, separating the content from the design with the aim of making future changes quicker and simpler.

After finishing this day, I was finally done with the web development module for the course. Although a lot of good information was provided, its length and design totally disrupted the day to day flow. I eventually powered through it and am happy with what I learned, but it did affect my motivation and I had to take a break for a while before coming back to it. To make it easier for myself, I broke up this project over several days and I also kept out a lot of the details, like the body text, to save time as it was a struggle for me to get through. I looked ahead in the course and the flow seems to get back to normal, which I look forward to, but in about 2 weeks, there is a day with 5 hours of video about [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and I may have to get creative about dealing with that day as well.
