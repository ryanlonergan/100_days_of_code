However, in general:

- Good information, but very long
- broke it up over several days
- looked ahead and for the next week or so, the class should resume to how it used to be
- html elements are positioned on top of their parents and are in effect, 2-d objects on a 3-d plane and their positioning is similar to how cel animation works.
