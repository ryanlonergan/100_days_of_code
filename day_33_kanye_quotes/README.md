# Kanye Quote Generator

<table border='0'>
<tr>
  <td>
  This project uses a GUI to generate quotes that Kanye West previously said. The quotes are provided by the <a href="https://kanye.rest/">kanye.rest</a> which is a really simple api. Everytime it is accessed at <a href="https://api.kanye.rest/">api.kanye.rest</a>, it returns a dictionary with a single random quote. The program then displays the quote to the user through a very basic <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html">tkinter</a> window and a new quote can be retrieved by clicking on Kanye's head.

I really enjoyed this project and decided to upload it even though it was just an exercise and not the main project from the day. I am guessing that the api was made because Kanye West sounds like kanye.rest and if that isn't a good enough reason to make a REST api, I don't know what is. While it may be a joke api, it provides an entertaining way to learn how to make requests and hopefully you like it as much as I do.
