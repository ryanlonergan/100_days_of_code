# Snake

  This project is a recreation of Snake using OOP to divide the logic and the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html">Turtle module</a> for the interface. The game is divided into different classes depending on their function with distinct files for the snake, food (turtles) and scoreboard with the UI and conditional logic in the <code>main.py</code> file. It also retains the global high score and retains it in a separate <code>data.txt</code> file.

This day's project was a fun exercise in OOP through dividing the logic of the program into separate classes. It was not difficult, but as I was still getting used to OOP best practices and knowing when to use them, it provided some challenges that took me some time to figure out. However, I came away with a greater understanding of how to break up a project based on the process to make it easier to add functionality later on. As the program used the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html">Turtle module</a>, I decided to use the turtle shape for the food as a homage instead of the apple in the traditional game. Overall, I had a good time coding this project and look forward to working on other games.
