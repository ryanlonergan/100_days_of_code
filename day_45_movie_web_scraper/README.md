  This page is a template to copy and paste for each day. I don't like the table borders, but they are controlled by github. It looks pretty clean, so oh well.

Any comments for the day.

- https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lists/100-best-films-ever-hollywood-favorites-818512
- Issue with react.js instead of pure html
    - not obvious until you use soup.prettify() to see what the page returned
    - One way to fix was to use selenium web driver, but that was coming up later in the course
    - elected for simpler option of using a different website
